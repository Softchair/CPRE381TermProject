Oh no...

Cycle: 6
MARS instruction number: 7	Instruction: addi $8,$0,2
Expected:	Register Write to Reg: 0x08 Val: 0x00000002
Got     :	Register Write to Reg: 0x01 Val: 0x000000AF
Incorrect write

Cycle: 8
MARS instruction number: na	Instruction: na
Expected:	Execution stopped
Got     :	Register Write to Reg: 0x01 Val: 0x000000AF
Student execution improperly continued

Almost! your processor completed the program with  2/3 allowed mismatches

Helpful resources for Debugging:
ms.trace : output from the VHDL testbench during program execution on your processor
mars.trace : output from MARS containing expected output
vsim.wlf: waveform file generated by processor simulation, you can display this simulation in ModelSim without resimulating your processor by hand
