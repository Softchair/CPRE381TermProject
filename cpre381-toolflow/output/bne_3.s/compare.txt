Oh no...

Cycle: 4
MARS instruction number: 5	Instruction: addi $1,$0,175
Expected:	No Overflow
Got     :	Overflow
Overflow is incorrect

Cycle: 6
MARS instruction number: 7	Instruction: addi $8,$0,2
Expected:	Register Write to Reg: 0x08 Val: 0x00000002
Got     :	Register Write to Reg: 0x01 Val: 0x000000AF
Incorrect write

Cycle: 8
MARS instruction number: na	Instruction: na
Expected:	Execution stopped
Got     :	Register Write to Reg: 0x01 Val: 0x000000AF
Student execution improperly continued
