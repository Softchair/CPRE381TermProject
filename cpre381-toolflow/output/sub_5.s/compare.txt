Oh no...

Cycle: 2
MARS instruction number: 3	Instruction: sub $22,$20,$21
Expected:	Register Write to Reg: 0x16 Val: 0x00000015
Got     :	Register Write to Reg: 0x15 Val: 0x00000000
Incorrect write

Almost! your processor completed the program with  1/3 allowed mismatches

Helpful resources for Debugging:
ms.trace : output from the VHDL testbench during program execution on your processor
mars.trace : output from MARS containing expected output
vsim.wlf: waveform file generated by processor simulation, you can display this simulation in ModelSim without resimulating your processor by hand
