Helpful resources for Debugging:
ms.trace : output from the VHDL testbench during program execution on your processor
mars.trace : output from MARS containing expected output
vsim.wlf: waveform file generated by processor simulation, you can display this simulation in ModelSim without resimulating your processor by hand
