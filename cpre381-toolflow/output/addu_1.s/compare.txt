Oh no...

Cycle: 1
MARS instruction number: 2	Instruction: addi $9,$0,-3
Expected:	No Overflow
Got     :	Overflow
Overflow is incorrect

Cycle: na
MARS instruction number: 3	Instruction: addu $10,$8,$9
Expected:	Register Write to Reg: 0x0A Val: 0xFFFFFFFC
Got     :	Execution stopped
Student execution ended prematurely

Almost! your processor completed the program with  2/3 allowed mismatches

Helpful resources for Debugging:
ms.trace : output from the VHDL testbench during program execution on your processor
mars.trace : output from MARS containing expected output
vsim.wlf: waveform file generated by processor simulation, you can display this simulation in ModelSim without resimulating your processor by hand
