This repo contains 3 different MIPs cpu designs that slowly improve processor efficiency by implementing hazard avoidence and pipelining.

cpu:
 - This was the first design of the processor with no performance improvements
hwPipeline:
 - This contains the final version of the processor with all the various hardware improvments such as hazard avoidence and pipelining
swPipeline:
 - This contains a verison of the processor that utilized a software pipeline to improve processor speed
