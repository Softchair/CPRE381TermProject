Oh no...

Cycle: 1
MARS instruction number: 2	Instruction: addi $9,$0,10
Expected:	No Overflow
Got     :	Overflow
Overflow is incorrect

Cycle: 3
MARS instruction number: 4	Instruction: addi $11,$0,10
Expected:	Register Write to Reg: 0x0B Val: 0x0000000A
Got     :	Register Write to Reg: 0x08 Val: 0x0000000A
Incorrect write

Cycle: 4
MARS instruction number: na	Instruction: na
Expected:	Execution stopped
Got     :	Register Write to Reg: 0x08 Val: 0x0000000A
Student execution improperly continued

Helpful resources for Debugging:
ms.trace : output from the VHDL testbench during program execution on your processor
mars.trace : output from MARS containing expected output
vsim.wlf: waveform file generated by processor simulation, you can display this simulation in ModelSim without resimulating your processor by hand
